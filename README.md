not the easiest, neither just work hard and maximize hours per week. TELL A STORY !!!

Who I am what I have been doing ... always loved maths, but "too dry to study, hated derivations -> medicine. zurich, IFMSA - >Japan. 
too clinical, too much admin, too broad. Loved diving deeper. turned to BMS. phd neurosciences fascinated by complicated networks. by conceptualizing complex stuff such as human perception and cognition.

STRENGTHS ... holistic view .. broad background ... priorization, communication, analytical, sceptical (sometimes too).

WEAKNESSES: sometimes too sceptical. nothing is perfect. So we'll just have to go ahead with 96% accuracy if we can't do any better. Fighting for the last 4% is usually not worth its tim e...

AUTODIDACT, addicted to learning new stuff. fell in love with innovation. always looking for methods to increase efficiency, output and, above all, VALUE. 

my private projects ... develop android app for my personal garden planning. algorithmic trading. create algorithms for TexasHoldem.
