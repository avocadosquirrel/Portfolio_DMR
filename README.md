# Welcome to my GitHub Repository! / world?

I am very pleased to see you've found your way through my Portfolio. My name is Diana, I live in Switzerland and am a neuroscientist by education. However - please don't take this too serious! You might just as well call me a ML Engineer, Data Scientist, Statistician, Clinical Researcher, Medical Writer or even Relationships Manager. Also passionate gardener, mommy of two daughters, macro photographer would fit quite well.

Let me introduce myself ... USE DATA SCIENCE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE ONLY ALL RELEVANT TO MY DREAM JOB !!!! :))))))))))) !! AMEISE; DIE DAS NADELDING TRÃ GT!!! DO THE RIGHT THING!!! 
not the easiest, neither just work hard and maximize hours per week. TELL A STORY !!!

I have always loved maths & modeling. At the age of 18, I had the chance to work for ABB Semiconductors during my school holidays and modeled heat spread from differently shaped thyristors. One was finger-gate, I don't remember the second. Whether you believe it or not - back in 2003, this task involved ruler and pencil! I would love to hear from ABB, whether a more efficient method for solving this task has in the meantime been invented.

Since I however hated conducting mathematical proofs, studying maths was no option to me. Rather architecture or graphical design. I ended up at Human Medicine and got to learn about an association organizing research exchange stays for Swiss Medical Students. This took me to Japan (Hokkaido University, Molecular Pathology), where I spent three amazing months in 2008. During my 5th semester, I realized not desiring to become a medical doctor. Too much bureaucracy, too broad the scope, eventually mostly a classification problem accompanied by too much noise around my personal signals of interest. I have always loved to dive deeper, truly understand relationships and mechanisms. This made me turn towards Biomedical Sciences, followed by a PhD in Neuroscience (/Medical Sciences). I am fascinated by the complex networks of our brains and by the fact that such abstract things as human cognition and perception can be conceptualized at all. Or should we better say: that scientists out there believe, they could?

My PhD covered a wide range of hypotheses and methods, but was mostly about the quest for revealing the function of a previously undiscovered aggregation of cells in the rodent brain. We manipulated this lateral hypothalamic nucleus using various approaches (lesional, chemogenetic and optogenetic) and my task was to quantify both the degree, to which our manipulation was successful, and the resulting change in behavior or vital parameters. I came into touch with Transmission Electron as well as Confocal Microscopy, the foundations of stereology, segmentation techniques, and many more. In parallel to finishing my PhD, I started working as a Medical Writer and composed the State-of-the-Art section for Clinical Evaluation Reports of Medical Devices in Traumatology/Orthopaedics. 

Although it would have been very interesting to continue the hypothalamic story further (I am actually still working on that, too, just shifted from SPSS to R and python in the meantime...), I felt the desire to create more immediate impact in another domain, to turn back towards more clinical medicine. I therefore joined the University Hospital of Bern in 2018, where Switzerland's first Clinical Data Science Center (add hyperlink!!!!!!) was just being established. My purpose there was to write, but my secret thought in the back of my head grew stronger and told me to finally do what I had always dreamt of: turn back towards numbers, maths, data, modeling. 

I am very grateful to Omdena for having selected me as one of ~60 developers from all over the world allowed to contribute to a recently ongoing 8-week NLP project about preventing online violence against children. 

I have several private projects in my mind, am planning to develop an android app to support my personal garden planning from 2021 onwards. I am addicted to learning new stuff that will help the earth to turn not only more efficiently, but also more sustainably. I fell in love with innovation and am an autodidact at heart, always eager to increase efficiency, output, and, above all, VALUE. Value for all patients worldwide, for our recent society completely overwhelmed by the challenges related to the outbreak of Covid-19, for my own personal environment, as well as for the employers with whom I work. 

In case you are curious about how I see myself in 5 or 10 years, I have to admit wondering about that myself, too. The world is too dynamic for me to have such an answer at hand already today. I will thus just continue sowing many little plans in our garden in the continuous hope of by whichever means being contributing to making this world a better place to live. Be it for patients of any species, children of any ethnicity or any other living creature except for Sars-COV2.
